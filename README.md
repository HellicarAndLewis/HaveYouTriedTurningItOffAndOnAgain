# HaveYouTriedTurningItOffAndOnAgain
A travelling show of interactions.

The first, "Digital Ephemera" uses smile detection to set up a feedback loop between viewer and a projection of viral films from the internet.

The second "Quartet" (aka Feedback) uses a series of graphical interpretations of movement drawn from Hellicar&Lewisâ€™s previous work in dance and therapeutic interaction to create a tetralogy of screens that respond to each other and the viewers movement.
